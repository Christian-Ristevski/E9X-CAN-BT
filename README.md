# E9X-CAN-BT

## Problem Description
Many of the E9X series of BMW cars were manufactured without support for bluetooth music playback. To modernize these cars, many vendors have begun selling bluetooth-AUX modules of different kinds. The modules all come with the same problem, they aren't connected to the car's CAN network and therefore cannot utilize the built-in steering wheel radio controls. Forcing a driver to scramble around with their phone while driving is both inconvenient and unsafe and should prove easy to adress by designing a bluetooth module with CAN read functionality.
